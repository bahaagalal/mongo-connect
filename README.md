[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bahaagalal/mongo-connect.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bahaagalal/mongo-connect)

A small library that exposes a function to easily connect to mongo db server, selects a db and fire callback.

*Disclaimer:* I've created such library to be used in my projects
